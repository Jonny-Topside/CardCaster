# CardCaster

Midterm project for Full Sail University, worked in a group of 4, then 3 in Unity. Created a First-Person shooter involving a deck-based magic system. I worked on most UI for the game, creation of my own enemy, as well as level design and general debugging and help across all different parts of the project including AI, player functionality and Unity problems.
